                     Put your loving hand out, baby <br>
                     'Cause I'm beggin' <br>
                     I'm beggin', beggin' you <br>
                     So put your loving hand out, baby <br>
                     I'm beggin', beggin' you <br>
                     So put your loving hand out, darling <br>
                     Riding high, when I was king <br>
                     I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything <br>
                     I walked away, but you warned me then <br>
                     But easy come and easy go, and it would end <br>
                     So anytime I bleed, you let me go <br>
                     Yeah, anytime I feed you, get me? No? <br>
                     Anytime I seek you, let me know <br>
                     But I plan and see, just let me go <br>
                     I'm on my knees when I'm beggin' <br>
                     'Cause I don't want to lose you <br>
                     Hey yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta <br>
                     'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you <br>
                     And put your loving hand out, baby <br>
                     I'm beggin', beggin' you <br>
                     And put your loving hand out, darling <br>
                     I need you to understand <br>
                     Tried so hard to be your man <br>
                     The kind of man you want in the end <br>
                     Only then can I begin to live again <br>
                     An empty shell, I used to be <br>
                     The shadow of my life was hangingover me <br>
                     A broken man that I don't know <br>
                     Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul <br>
                     What we doing? What we chasing? <br>
                     Why the bottom? Why the basement? <br>
                     Why we got good shit, don't embrace it? <br>
                     Why the feel for the need to replace me? <br>

You're the wrong way track from the good <br>
I want to paint a picture telling where we could be at <br>
Like a heart in the best way should <br>
You can give it away, you had, and you took the pay 
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for, that the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'
Mhm, yeah
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darling
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darling
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out
